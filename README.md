# WindowsInstallation

Run the Auto.bat file and it will automatically deinstall all bloatware (incl. Edge and Cortana) and installs Chrome, FileZilla, Winrar and VLC.

It also sets my favorite Theme, tries to activate Windows (With the help of the Activationserver from msguides.com) and costumizes the Taskbar.

Everything in about 30 Seconds!
